To the horror of, I assume most ‘hardcore’ jazz fans, I started listening to the genre after watching ‘La La Land’. As part of it, I wanted to take the piano skills I already had and expand them to playing jazz piano. So, I bought a book filled with complicated chords and complex melodies and then forgot about it for a while, picking it back up in 2020 in a not-new-years resolution. To help learn chords when not at the piano, I created a little guess the right answer game: Chord Theory.

However, jazz has a lot to it. One question set wouldn’t be enough, and so after initially just creating a javascript game, I decided to expand it to be built with react and node, as well as a PostgreSQL database to store user info (such as stats on how many right answers a user got) and redis for additional security in signing people in with tokens.
